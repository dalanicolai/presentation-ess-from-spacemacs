#+title: ESS with Spacemacs

* Goals of this presentation

1. Ultra-quick start guide to ESS via spacemacs
2. Give pointers for further spacemacs use

* What is spacemacs?

#+begin_quote
The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs and Vim!
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency 
#+end_quote

* Ultra-quick start guide

** Clone the repository

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d 
#+end_src

** Start emacs and choose your keybindings

** Open the configuration file: =SPC f e d=

** Set up your layers in =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   '(
     better-defaults
     emacs-lisp
     ess
     git
     helm
     org
     (shell :variables
            shell-default-height 30
            shell-default-position 'bottom)
     syntax-checking
     version-control)
#+end_src

** Restart: =SPC q r=

** Profit!

- =SPC f f= to find an R file
- =SPC m '= to start a REPL
- =SPC m <x>= to run commands where =<x>=
  + =s b= /sends/ the /buffer/
  + =s r= /sends/ the /region/

* More spacemacs

#+begin_quote
ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency 
#+end_quote

** ergonomics

Keybindings start with =SPC= and everything uses helm

** mnemonics

Often you can guess the keybindings for common functionality

- /files/ =SPC f=
  + /find file/ =SPC f f=
  + dired /jump/ =SPC f j=
- /modes/ =SPC m=
  + /go/ to a definition =SPC m g=
  + /send/ code to the REPL =SPC m s=
- /buffers/ =SPC b=
- /windows/ =SPC w=
- /quit/ =SPC q=
  
** consistency

bindings are fairly consistent across layers
