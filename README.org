1. Motivation for spacemacs
   - opinionated quick-start configuration
   - vim/emacs keybindings
   - "ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency"
   - setting up your layers
2. How setting up ESS differs for spacemacs (following the steps in
   [[https://github.com/ess-intro/presentation-ess-base-install][presentation-ess-base-install]]).
   - Basically, add the =ess= layer and you're good to go
3. How to learn more about spacemacs
   - Navigating the website and layers list
   - How to incorporate your own configuration
